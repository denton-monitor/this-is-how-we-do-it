# Start Here

To all my neighbors: You got much flavor. (This is how we do it.) :radio:

## What is Denton Monitor?
The answer to that question goes here, probably a mission statement. End with slogan to make it punchy.

## How do I navigate this repo?
Files that will be edited (possibily semi-)regularly are
- *README.md*: This file. It's a readme.
- *OtherFile.md*: I'm sure there will be more eventually.

The wiki contains information such as how-tos, style guides. Generally, how we do things.
- *Workflow*: Getting it done. Step by step. I really think it's just a matter of time.
- *Contributing Code*: So you want to make the site better? Info on becoming a collaborator and PRs here.
- *Style Guide*: How your code should look.
- *Contributing Content*: What we're looking for, how to get in contact.
- *Content Guide*: Stay classy, San D-enton.
